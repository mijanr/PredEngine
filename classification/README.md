# Classification Models

Classification models are a type of predictive modeling technique used to classify or categorize data into different groups based on the input variables. 

In predictive modeling, classification models are commonly used to make predictions about binary outcomes, such as whether an email is spam or not, whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not, or whether a patient has a particular disease or not. 

Classification models can also be used to predict the probability of an event, rather than simply classifying it into one of two categories.

## Models
Various ML/DL models are used for classification tasks. Some of the popular models are:
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Networks
- etc.
