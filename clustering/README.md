# Clustering 

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning. It is used to group data points that are similar to each other. In clustering, we do not have any target variable to predict. We only have the input data points. Clustering is used to find patterns in data. It is used in market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, etc.


## Algorithms

There are many clustering algorithms. Some of the popular clustering algorithms are:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. DBSCAN
4. Mean Shift
5. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering etc.

## Dataset
 - **Customer Segmentation**
     - The dataset contains information about customers of a mall. The goal is to segment customers based on their spending habits and annual income.
 - Banknote Authentication
     - The dataset contains information about the attributes of banknotes. The goal is to cluster the banknotes into genuine and forged categories.

## Tasks

1. Banknote Authentication [Notebook](BanknoteAuthentication.ipynb)
