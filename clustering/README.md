# Clustering 

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning. It is used to group data points that are similar to each other. In clustering, we do not have any target variable to predict. We only have the input data points. Clustering is used to find patterns in data. It is used in market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, etc.
