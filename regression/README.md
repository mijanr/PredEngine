# Regression Models

Regression models are a type of predictive modeling technique used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

In predictive modeling, regression models are commonly used to make predictions about continuous numerical variables. They can be used to predict outcomes such as sales revenue, stock prices, or housing prices, among others. Regression models can also be used to identify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables, allowing us to understand the impact of different factors on the outcome.

## Models
Various ML/DL models are used for regression tasks. Some of the popular models are:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks
- etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for regression tasks is:
- Insurance Price Prediction
    - The dataset contains information about customers and their insurance premiums. The goal is to predict the insurance price based on the available features.


## Tasks

1. Insurance Price Prediction [Notebook](InsurancePricePrediction.ipynb)
    - XGBoost
    - Random Forest

`Optuna` is used for hyperparameter tuning in the regression models.
