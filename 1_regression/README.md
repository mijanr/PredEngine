# **Regression Models**

Regression models are a type of predictive modeling technique used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

In predictive modeling, regression models are commonly used to make predictions about continuous numerical variables. They can be used to predict outcomes such as sales revenue, stock prices, or housing prices, among others. Regression models can also be used to identify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables, allowing us to understand the impact of different factors on the outcome.
